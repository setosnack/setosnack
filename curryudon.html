<h1>Curry Udon</h1>

    <p align=left>This is a quick & easy curry noodle that has a rich flavor despite having only a few ingredients. </br>
        You can easily add in extra ingredients as you see fit or modify the portions of each depending </br>
        on your preferences. For example, if you wanted to add a stronger flavor base, you could make a </br>
        ginger garlic paste and add in the whites of green onions prior to adding in your onions.</br> </br>
    
        Notes: </br> </br>

        If you are planning to use tofu in this dish, it would be best to boil the tofu for about 1-2 minutes in lightly </br>
        salted water as this will both help to season the tofu and remove some of the taste it acquires from the container it comes in. </br>
        Both the curry roux and udon noodles can be made from scratch if youâ€™d like.</br>
        Most pre-made curry packets are not that spicy, so you can add in extra heat by adding </br>
        in red pepper powder or adding in finely chopped red chiles and cook them alongside the garlic.</br>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Heavy Cream (8oz)</li>
<li>Half a large white onion, cut into slivers</li>
<li>6-8 cloves of garlic, chopped coarsely</li>
<li>Meat of choice, ~0.5lbs (can be substituted with mushrooms or tofu)</li>
<li>Udon noodles (230g per person)</li>
<li>Curry Roux brick (1/2 a piece from a brick) </li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat up a wok on medium high heat and then add in about 2 tablespoons of oil</li>
    <li>Fry the garlic for 10 seconds until fragrant</li>
    <li>Add in onions and cook until translucent, which should take no more than 1-2 minutes</li>
    <li>Add in meat and cook until onions begin to caramelize and meat is nearly fully cooked. </li>
    <li>Add in cream, lower heat, and begin stirring in the curry roux</li>
    <li>Once the roux has completely dissolved, remove the wok from heat and season with salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Garnish with whatever you like - we used green onions and broccoli sprouts in ours to add some lightness to the rich taste of the curry.</li>
    </ol>
